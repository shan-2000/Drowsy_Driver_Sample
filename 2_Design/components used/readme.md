## Pin Descriptions:
### Port A (PA7-PA0): 
Port A serves as analog inputs for A/D converter. It also acts as an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port if the A/D converter is not used internally.

### Port B (PB7-PB0) and Port D (PD7-PD0):
These ports are 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports. Their output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with high source and sink capability. As inputs, these are pulled low if the pull-up resistors are used. It also provides various special functional features of the ATmega32.

### Port C (PC7-PC0): Port C is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port. If the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface is enabled, the pull-up resistors on pins PC2 (TCK), PC3 (TMS), and PC5 (TDI) will be activated.
